This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository locally and make sure you create a .env file with `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` for whatever your localhost is.

CD into the repository and run `npm install` to install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to your localhost to see the result, by default I used [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
