# Couchsurfing App Notes

### Pseudo Code Steps
1. Set up Nextjs Project
2. Create mock user data for project
3. Create API routes to serve user data
4. Add error handling for API routes
5. Add testing for API routes
6. Create React app 
7. Create main display to list all users
8. Create user profile pages
9. Add styling and unit tests

### Time Permitting
10. Add relationship attribute (friends, family)
11. Add friend list to user page
12. Navigate to profiles between friends lists

## My Thoughts
- I definitely didn't build the app the way I would have wanted given the time parameters.
- I wish I had time to add testing, error handling, and error pages
- I chose React and tailwind because they come with Next but I wouldn't choose such heavy libraries typically for such a simple project.
- The UI definitely leaves something to be desired given the time constraints.
- I don't live that all the React pages are server side and not client side, but it was a choice made for speed.
- There is probably a better way to create the routes and pass the data, this was definitely a beta version and quick and dirty.
- I could definitely spend days on this, so 2 hours is probably the right time constraints.
